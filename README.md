# ezblender-boilerplate

**ezblender is still under heavy development, breaking changes are common**

ezblender is a simple wrapper module to make developing Blender addons simpler. It provides a separate and greatly simplified interface to some of the most common Blender operations, such as creating objects, modifying meshes, and inserting animation keyframes.

## Prerequisites
* Blender version 2.79
* Basic knowledge of the Python programming language
* Basic knowledge of Blender

## Installation/Setup

1. Navigate to your blender addons folder: `Blender/2.79/scripts/addons`<br/><br/>
2. Clone/extract this repository into the `Blender/2.79/scripts/addons` folder (so that it now contains the folder `ezblender_boilerplate`)<br/><br/>
2.1. **Optional:** rename the `ezblender_boilerplate` folder to the name of your own addon<br/><br/>
2.2. **Optional:** Navigate into `ezblender_boilerplate` and open the file `__init__.py`, here you can change some basic addon fields: addon name, author and category right at the top.<br/><br/>
3. Start Blender and open the addons settings window, search for `EZBlender` (or your new name) and enable the addon
